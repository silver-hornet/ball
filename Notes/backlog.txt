Bug fixing
- Made music play only after you actually start a difficulty level
- Player can move off the platform despite the boundary limit (if you keep holding the cursor, the player will keep moving further outside the limit due to physics)
- Player sticks to boundaries (probably to do with friction and other physics) (fixed this as a side effect of fixing the bug above)
- Change enemy spawn positions
- Powerup can spawn in wall (did a workaround by not spawning in that area of the level)
- Powerups only show up on a z axis of 10
- Player falls off edge after game over
- Powerup indicator stops moving after death (no longer a problem after above bug fix)
- Projectiles shoot through wall and door
- Powerup duration doesn’t expire if you don’t shoot any projectiles
- Powerup doesn’t work every second time (after the first time wears off and within 5 seconds of picking the second one)
- Powerup indicator doesn’t move well with player
